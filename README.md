# ionic-react-toast-queue
A barebones implementation of a queue for presenting toasts in Ionic React

This was created in a new, blank Ionic React project. All the code for the toast queue is found in [src/pages/Home.tsx](https://github.com/DevonStern/ionic-react-toast-queue/blob/master/src/pages/Home.tsx).
